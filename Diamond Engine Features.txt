6. UI EDITOR!!! (In game not menus)
Modify the playstate UI To a custom one (Now you can make your forks properly)

7. Options
Added new options and replace ones (Listed all below)

	- Accuracy type: Simple, Complex, Osu!Mania
	- Motion blur: Adds motion blur to notes with intensity adjustable.
	- Low Detail Mode (Also ULDM): 
		LDM: Disables intense shaders like Blur, And other intense shaders marked as "Intense"
		ULDM: Disables camGame, All the UI Except for combo and arrows. And disables every single event (Not including Modchart events)
	- Botplay: A bot plays the game (Press Shift + F5 For enable during the song)
	- Fix hold notes: Instead of separated images, the hold tail merges in a only scripted image (Better for insane modcharts)
	- Ratings on camGame: Changes the pos of the ratings to the camGame (Like Funkin master)
	- Pre-cached assets: Loads the images, scripts, and audios when load a song and open the game. It makes loadings faster but consumes more RAM.

	- Show MS: Setup Ms and how many decimals will be have (2 by default)
	- Bring back buggy icon bump: brings back the buggy icon bump see it on Forever Engine, Kade engine (1.7 and down) and other engines.
	- Cinematic mode: Perfect for high-effort visually mods. It makes the camera more smoother, add cinematic bars, And hide almost all the UI (F5 In game for show/hide. Thanks Hoken)

8. Skins!!? (I mean really Skins, Not change the arrows assets)
Change every fucking asset in game with skins. Create a Skins folder and put your skins there similar to Osu! (Zipped or unzipped)
